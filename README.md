## Requirements

Installing nvm on Windows:

- Install nvm for windows from - https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows
- Check if nvm is installed by going to your command line and typing `nvm --v`
- If it's installed, next: `nvm install 14.18.0`
- Make sure you're on administrative privileges: `nvm use 14.18.0` (you can also type in "nvm use latest")
- Check if npm and node are installed by typing `node -v` and `npm -v`


To finish setup complete the following:

- Install TypeScript globally: `npm install typescript -g`
- Install packages: `npm install`


## Developing

- Run application: `npm run dev`
